# üìù Personal Notes on Technical Subjects

Here I gather my personal notes on software development, mostly focused on system architecture and API design.  
The goal of this repository is to document and share ideas on building software components that are **reusable**, **efficient**, and **scalable** ‚Äî with a strong emphasis on real-world practices.
